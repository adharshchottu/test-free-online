      Understanding Prelims Exam Scoring
    </div>
    <p>
      Competitive exams often use a complex scoring system that includes negative marking. 
      The final score calculation considers not just the correct answers, but also penalizes for incorrect attempts.
      This system helps to discourage random guessing and rewards precise knowledge and careful answering strategies.

    <div class="text-white text-2xl mb-4">How to Use This Calculator</div>
    <p>
      Our Prelims Marks Calculator makes it easy to determine your score without complex calculations. Simply input your exam parameters:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
      <li>Total number of questions in the exam</li>
      <li>Total maximum marks available</li>
      <li>Negative marking ratio (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 2/3)</li>
      <li>Number of questions you attempted</li>
      <li>Number of questions you answered incorrectly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The calculator will instantly provide your score, showing both the raw marks and the percentage. 
      You'll also see a breakdown of marks per question, correct answers count, and total negative marks deducted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding how negative marking affects your score can help shape your exam strategy. 
      For exams with significant negative marking (like 1/2 or 2/3), it's often better to attempt only questions you're confident about. 
      With milder negative marking (like 1/4), you might take more calculated risks on questions where you can eliminate some options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this calculator during your practice tests to find your optimal answering strategy and maximize your final score!
