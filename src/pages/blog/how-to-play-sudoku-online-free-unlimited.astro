            Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle that challenges players to
            fill a 9x9 grid with digits 1-9, ensuring each number appears
            exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid. Our online
            version is built with Vue.js for smooth performance and includes
            modern features like real-time validation, confetti celebrations,
            and responsive design that works perfectly on all devices.
