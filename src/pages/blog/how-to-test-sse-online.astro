          > is designed to help you test Server-Sent Events (SSE) in a simple and
          effective way. In this guide, I'll show you how to use the app step by
          step. Don't worry if you're new to SSE; this guide will walk you through
          everything easily.

          <h3 class="text-white text-2xl my-4">What Is SSE?</h3>

          SSE (Server-Sent Events) allows a server to send real-time updates to
          the browser without the browser asking for them. It's useful for
          things like notifications, live updates, or streaming data. The SSE
          Tester app lets you test how your server sends these events.

          <h2 class="text-white text-3xl my-4">Getting Started</h2>

          <h3 class="text-white text-2xl my-4">
            Step 1: Open the <a
              href="https://test-free.online/sse/"
              target="_blank"
              class="text-primaryColor font-bold">App</a>
          </h3>
          When you open the app, you'll see a simple interface with a few input fields
          and buttons.

          <h3 class="text-white text-2xl my-4">Step 2: Enter the SSE URL</h3>
          At the top of the app, there's a text box that says "Enter SSE URL." This
          is where you'll put the URL of the SSE stream you want to test. If you're
          unsure, a good starting URL might be <span
            class="text-primaryColor font-bold"
            >https://sse.test-free.online/api/story</span
          >, which is the default one in the app.

          <h3 class="text-white text-2xl my-4">
            Step 3: Connect to the SSE Stream
          </h3>
          Once you've entered the URL, click the "Connect" button. The app will try
          to connect to the server and start receiving messages. If the connection
          is successful, you'll see a "Connected" status. If there are any issues
          with the connection, the app will show an error message.

          <h3 class="text-white text-2xl my-4">Step 4: View the Messages</h3>
          Once connected, you'll see the messages from the server displayed in the
          message box. The messages will appear in real-time as the server sends
          them.

          <br />
          You can choose how to view the messages:
          <ListItem
            list={[
              {
                title: "Normal Mode",
                description:
                  "This will display the messages one by one as they arrive.",
              },
              {
                title: "Story Mode",
                description:
                  "This option combines all the messages into a single story-like text. You can turn this mode on or off by checking the 'Story Mode' checkbox.",
              },
            ]}
            client:visible
          />

          <h3 class="text-white text-2xl my-4">Step 5: Disconnect</h3>
          When Done When you're done testing, simply click the "Disconnect" button.
          This will close the connection to the server.

          <ListItem
            list={[
              {
                title: "No Connection",
                description:
                  "If the app fails to connect, double-check the URL you entered. Make sure it's a valid SSE stream.",
              },
              {
                title: "Connection Issues",
                description:
                  "Sometimes, the app might try to reconnect if the connection is unstable. The status will update accordingly.",
              },
            ]}
            client:visible
          />
